# Randomly-Generate-Test-Cases-for-2D-Convolution

Simple as it is, I implement it in three distinct languages: Kotlin, Python (by PyTorch), and Haskell, which brings me some interesting insights.

## Dependencies for Haskell

```
dependencies:
- base >= 4.7 && < 5
- mtl
- containers
- filepath
- directory
- time
- string-interpolate
- array
```

## Dependencies for Python

```
pytorch
```
